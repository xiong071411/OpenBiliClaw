## Why OpenBiliClaw?

Recommendation systems are essentially a **middleman** — the platform sits between millions of videos and millions of users, matching and distributing content at scale. Modern systems are far more sophisticated than "just optimizing CTR": they jointly weigh click-through rate, completion rate, like/coin probability, dwell time, user retention, creator ecosystem health, ad revenue, and a dozen other objectives, compressing them into a single weighted ranking score. Sounds scientific, but here's the catch: **the weights are set by the platform, and the optimization targets ultimately serve the platform** — user satisfaction is valued as a means to retention and monetization, not as an end in itself. You think you're choosing content, but really the middleman decides what you get to see. The result: recommendations look more and more like what you've already watched, and the occasional surprise is pure luck.

**OpenBiliClaw is fundamentally different.** It's a locally-running AI Agent that doesn't care what everyone else watches. Instead, it understands **who you are**:

### 🧠 Understands *why* you like things, not just *what* you've watched

It infers your MBTI, cognitive style, and deep psychological needs from your behaviour, building a five-layer soul profile (Event → Preference → Awareness → Insight → Soul). It's not matching video tags — it's understanding you as a person.

### 🔮 Actively breaks your filter bubble

This is the core differentiator: the system **guesses domains you might enjoy but have never explored**. Someone into mechanical watches might love architectural aesthetics; a quantum physics viewer might resonate with philosophy — it uses psychological bridging logic to proactively explore, promotes correct guesses to real interests, and quietly retires wrong ones.

### 🔒 100% local, 100% yours

All data lives in a single SQLite file on your disk. LLM calls use your own API key. No cloud, no accounts, no one else can see your profile. How this Agent grows is entirely your call — send feedback, chat with it, swap LLMs, edit the database, whatever you want.

> 💡 **How it compares**
>
> | | Bilibili Official | Keyword Filter Plugins | OpenBiliClaw |
> |---|---|---|---|
> | Recommendation logic | Collaborative filtering | Tag matching | Psychological profiling + 5-layer memory |
> | Filter bubble | Gets narrower | Doesn't address it | Speculative interests actively break it |
> | Data ownership | Platform-owned | Usually cloud | 100% local |
> | Explains why | "Guess you'll like" | None | Friend-like explanations |
> | Customizable | No | Low | Swap LLMs / edit profile / write Skills |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 🧩 Step 1: Install the Chrome Extension

The extension is your main interface — it shows recommendations in a Bilibili side panel, collects behavior, and lets you chat with the agent.

1. Download the latest [`openbiliclaw-extension.zip`](https://github.com/whiteguo233/OpenBiliClaw/releases/latest)
2. Open `chrome://extensions/`, enable "Developer mode" in the top right
3. Drag the downloaded `.zip` file into the page to install

> Developers can also `cd extension && npm install && npm run package` to build from source.

### ⚡ Step 2: Deploy the Backend

**⭐ Download the backend desktop package from Releases (recommended for most users):**

1. Open [OpenBiliClaw Releases](https://github.com/whiteguo233/OpenBiliClaw/releases/latest)
2. Download the backend package for your OS:
   - macOS: `OpenBiliClaw-macos-*.zip`
   - Windows: `OpenBiliClaw-windows-*.zip`
3. Unzip it, launch the backend, then connect the extension to local `http://127.0.0.1:8420`

> ⚠️ The first desktop backend packages are unsigned. macOS may show Gatekeeper prompts and Windows may show SmartScreen warnings. If you would rather avoid OS security prompts, use the installer script or Docker paths below instead.

**⭐ Paste to an AI coding agent for one-click deploy (recommended — works with Claude Code / Codex CLI / Cursor etc.):**

```text
Please follow https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whiteguo233/OpenBiliClaw/main/docs/agent-install.md to deploy the OpenBiliClaw backend for me (use Bash `curl` to fetch the document, NOT WebFetch — WebFetch summarises markdown and drops critical commands).
```

**⭐ Have an AI agent deploy with Docker (recommended if you have Docker Desktop):**

```text
Please follow https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whiteguo233/OpenBiliClaw/main/docs/docker-deployment.md to deploy the OpenBiliClaw backend via Docker Compose (use Bash `curl` to fetch the document, NOT WebFetch).
```

**One terminal command:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whiteguo233/OpenBiliClaw/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

The desktop package is the easiest path for macOS and Windows users. `install.sh` remains the recommended path for macOS / Linux / WSL2 users who want a source-based setup. The only prerequisites for the script are `git` and `python3` (3.11+). It auto-clones the repo, installs dependencies, starts the backend, runs a health check, and prompts you to choose an LLM provider (OpenAI / Gemini / DeepSeek / Claude etc.) and fill in the corresponding API key and Bilibili cookie. Once credentials are set, it automatically runs first-time init (fetches history, builds your soul profile, fills the recommendation pool) so you're ready to go immediately.

> 💡 **On Windows?** If you already have Docker Desktop, use the Docker method above — it works out of the box. Otherwise, install [WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) first, then use the terminal command.

### Content Discovery Engine

Four strategies work in coordination, each with independent API quota:

| Strategy | Description | Quota |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| **Search** | Generates queries from interests + speculative interests | Fair share |
| **Trending** | Popular content from multiple Bilibili ranking categories | Fair share |
| **Related Chain** | Expands from seed videos along recommendation chains | Fair share |
| **Explore** | LLM-driven cross-domain exploration | Fair share |

Results go through multi-dimensional diversity selection: per-source reservation → topic deduplication → style balancing → ceiling caps, ensuring broad coverage in final recommendations.

### Soul Engine

Infers from user behavior:
- **Personality Portrait** — Natural language user profile
- **MBTI** — Four dimensions with confidence scores
- **Cognitive Style** — Information processing preferences
- **Deep Needs** — Psychological content drivers
- **Speculative Interests** — System-predicted potential interest domains (e.g., molecular gastronomy, architectural aesthetics, watchmaking...)

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- **Multi-platform content sources** — Beyond Bilibili. We plan to integrate general-purpose search engines, Xiaohongshu (Little Red Book), Douyin (TikTok China), and various web forums / BBS as content sources, so recommendations cover the content you actually care about across the entire web — not just a single platform.
