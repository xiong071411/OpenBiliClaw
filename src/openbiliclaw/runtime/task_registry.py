"""Background task registry for cancel-on-hot-reload.

The runtime spawns many ``asyncio.create_task(...)`` calls for detached
fire-and-forget work — per-strategy precompute, prewarm helpers,
per-event triggers, manual refresh handles. When config changes at
runtime (``RuntimeContext.rebuild_from_config``), only the top-level
loop tasks were previously cancelled; detached tasks kept running with
references to the OLD runtime object, competing with the freshly built
runtime for SQLite writes and LLM tokens for many seconds after rebuild.

``BackgroundTaskRegistry`` is the single chokepoint every detached task
should flow through. ``cancel_all`` is awaited at the very top of
``rebuild_from_config`` so the new runtime starts from a clean slate.

Backward compatibility note: every caller that previously used
``asyncio.create_task`` directly continues to work unmodified — the
registry is wired in optionally, and code paths that don't have one
fall back to bare ``create_task`` exactly as before. This keeps the
existing test suite green without forcing every test fixture to inject
a registry.
